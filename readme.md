<ul>
    <li>A file named "SECRETS.js" has been removed as it contains sensitive information such as private keys. Hence the code will not work. However, it can still be viewed for informational purposes</li>
    <li>The server in "Server.js" must be ran outside of a localhost, the callback URL will also need to be altered depending on what your URL is that your server is running on</li>
    <li>This code has been written with functionality in mind, over readability. Therefore many standard programming practices such as comments and consistent variable naming conventions have not been followed. in some cases</li>
</ul>

The code is written for the NodeJS environment, with some client-side code being written in pure JavaScript.

The entrance point is "index.js"

A running version of this code can be found on my Twitch channel "https://www.twitch.tv/thomasnottom_"
